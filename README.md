## 🧩 What This Project Does

This project uses **agent-based workflow orchestration** and **LLM coordination** (via [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/)) to simulate a product manager. It breaks down a raw product idea using 7 agents, each with a specific role, and automatically executes the agile cycle.

### 🎯 Input
- A vague product idea (text)
- Team metadata (JSON)

### ⚙️ Output
- Extracted domain, personas, features
- User stories and epics
- Skill-matched assignments
- Gantt-style timeline
- Mock progress report and blocker detection
- Dynamic timeline adjustments
- Email + markdown sprint summary
